## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chrome/ChromeDriver Issues:**
- The tool automatically downloads and manages ChromeDriver
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed and up to date
- WebDriver Manager handles version compatibility automatically

**Login Problems:**
- Use "Login & Save Cookies" action in GUI for initial setup
- Ensure you complete login within the 60-second window
- Check for two-factor authentication requirements
- Clear cookies file if authentication fails: delete `linkedin_cookies.pkl`

**No Attendees Found:**
- Event may be private or have restricted attendee visibility
- Verify the Event ID is correct (19-digit number)
- Ensure your LinkedIn account has access to view the event
- Check the log area for specific error messages

**GUI/Display Issues:**
- Disable headless mode to see browser activity
- Check the real-time log area for detailed progress updates
- Review `scraper_log.txt` for complete activity history

**Performance Optimization:**
- Enable headless mode for faster scraping
- Adjust delays in code if needed for different network speeds
- Use proxy settings for large-scale operations

### Configuration Options

**Headless Mode:** 
- Enabled by default for scraping efficiency
- Disable to watch browser activity for debugging

**Proxy Support:**
- Set `USE_PROXY = True` and configure `PROXY` variable in code
- Useful for enhanced privacy or bypassing rate limits

**Timing Adjustments:**
- Random delays (2-6 seconds) prevent detection
- Scrolling patterns mimic human behavior
- Configurable in the `scrape_event_attendees()` function
